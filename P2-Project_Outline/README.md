## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Design an app that will flag the ingredients of a product based on dietary needs. User will select the type of diet(s) that meet there needs, then the app will receive and analyze an image of the product's barcode label. Next, the app will take this barcode and match it to the ingredients from the USDA databse. User will receive a color coded list of the acceptable and unacceptable ingredients. If the user decides to have an account, then the app will offer to save this product to their account for future reference. In the user's account they will have the ability to mark favorite items, with notes and share with others. User will also be able to make a shopping list with their saved items and share this information. 

My siginificant other is a vegan and I am not. This inspired me to make an app that will assist with identifying foods that are vegan friendly. In addition, my significant other suggested to expand the app to include other dietary needs as well. This will assist others with different dietary needs in easily indentifying products that meet their needs.  

### Features
User login (optional): Users will be able to register and login. User will have a personal homepage.

Dietary Options: User selects dietary restriction(s) from a list of availabel diets.

Barcode Image Analysis: User uploads image of a product's barcode and the app will analyze the image, then look for ingredients that do not meet the dietary restrictions entered by the user.

Results Page: The app will display the ingredients and flag the ingredients that the user can have in a specific color, along with the ingredients that the user can't have in a different color. (Optional) If the user is logged in the page will also give the option to save the product and add any notes to the product (such as being exclusive to a specific store).
